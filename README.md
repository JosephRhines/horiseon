# horiseon website revamped
Description:
The Horiseon website had many problems and I was tasked to fix error and make the website more uniform. I updated the website by making corrections and changes to the html and css files.

Steps and Changes made:
HTML
1. Changed title from website to Horiseon to make it more professional
2. Changed most div tags to section tags
3. Fixed the word Horiseon so all the letters are located together in the h1 and span tags
4. fixed search-engine-optimization link by adding an id
5. Consolidated class search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing to core.
6. I changed the float back to what is was orignally, which right instead of left
7. Added alt descriptions to images
8. Added alt descriptions to png
9. I got rid of the /img tags
10. I linked the css file to the html file

CSS
1. I made the curly brackets uniform and organized
2. I deleted the font-size: 16px because it wasn't needed
3. Consolidated benefit-lead, benefit brand, and benefit cost to benefitsecondary.
   I also did the same for h3 and images.
4. I consolidated class search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing to core
   I did the same thing for img and h2
